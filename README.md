Welcome to our business booking application. Ensuring your privacy is a key principle of our work. This policy describes how we process your personal data, what data we collect, for what purposes we use and transfer it, as well as outlining your rights and your choices regarding your data.

This policy applies wherever our application is available, except for the countries where a jurisdiction-specific privacy policy is in place.

If there is an inconsistency between this policy and the local law, we will comply with the local law to the extent of the inconsistency.
